# Unique
Unique is an esoteric programming language where each number can only appear once.
Every variable in unique is stored in a single data structure, which functions as a stack of stacks.
You can find a description of how the language works [here](https://owenbechtel.com/unique).
Clone this repo and run the following commands to check if the interpreter works:
```
ghc -o unique Main.hs
./unique examples/hello-world.uniq
```
If you don't have haskell installed on your computer, you can download the executable file
from my website by clicking the link above.
