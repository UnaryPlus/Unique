# Unique
Unique is an esoteric programming language where each number can only occur once.
Every variable in Unique is stored in a single data structure: a stack of integer arrays.
You can find a description of how the language works [here](https://owenbechtel.com/unique).
Clone this repository and run the following commands to test if the interpreter works:
```
ghc -o unique Main.hs
./unique examples/hello-world.uniq
```
If you don't have Haskell installed on your computer, you can download the executable file
